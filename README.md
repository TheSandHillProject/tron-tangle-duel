# Welcome to Battle Tron

Simple web app based game that I made. I wanted to make a game that allowed to AIs to compete,
but didn't want something that was already out there on the internet (like snake, pong, tron, etc.).

So I came up with Battle Tron -- a two player game where you try to smother the opponent, and 
can collect tokens to carve out space.
